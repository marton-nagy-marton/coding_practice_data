2024-11-15T15:33:32.000Z;GB;Unprofessional and disrespectful…;"Unprofessional and disrespectful boarding gate staff. On the early morning flight from Gatwick to Malaga on the 5th of November, I queued to board and I found the woman's (I cannot call her lady), at the boarding gate check in, attitude was sharp, impolite and racist. She was not friendly to other than the English! Her attitude after checking my British passport was ""go and sit there"". I do not know what her background is and how she was brought up! Maybe she does not know to talk normal to people and how to respect others! Very bad for Wizz air  to recruit such people. I fly frequently with Wizz air and they are great, but need to pay attention who they recruit for serving their customers. Never came across such rude staff with any other airlines!";;YES;NO;NO;NO;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2024-11-14T02:34:36.000Z;GB;Cheap. Hidden costs. Noobs.;Well. Cheap... yes. Disorganised....yes. If you need to go somewhere and don't expect much more travel experience than a local bus service, then go for it. Some tips... if you are a family, pay extra to sit together, there is no guarantee for this type of basic expectation. Only book if the flight is less than 2 hours, you won't enjoy the comfort. Don't expect to put your bag in the overhead lockers. Dont expect they won't be extremely stringent on cabin bag sizes prior to boarding. Don't expect an orderly boarding process. And lastly, don't expect professional cabin crew - expect either total noobs, or one experienced pro with some noobs.;;YES;YES;NO;NO;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2024-11-12T21:29:14.000Z;GB;Luggage got badly damaged;"Luggage got badly damaged, including an item inside.
Customer service was bad at every level.
At the airport they refuse to add the item damaged inside the luggage to the report. The lady was claiming that they weren't refunding it and that I should have bought another one.
Links to follow up the case provided by Wizzair are just not working.
I submitted an online claim with `damagedluggage`, they took a few weeks to come back and say they cannot offer compensation since it was a sport luggage.
I submitted an online claim with Wizzair for which I didn't agree with the amount they wanted to refund. So they just closed the case and didn't care about it.
So 6 weeks later my luggage is unusable (badly cut allover), one item inside has been badly damaged, filled up a few forms/emails asking the same things again and again and in the end nothing from Wizzair...";;YES;NO;NO;Refund complains (can be under the service as well.;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On my way out my flight was cancelled I had to wait 6days. That meant everything else had to be rebooked! I didn't get a recompense for this. On my return we were delayed by 3 hours plus 1 hour change of time. And the direct flight ended up being none direct. The plain was late arriving we almost left 4 passengers behind two on wheel chairs. The crew had to be replaced and refuelled. had a collision with a bird while landing and one of the stewardesses was quiet rude to the passengers. We were three hours late and did not even have bottled water for dehydration. Instead of arriving at 8:20 pm we arrived 30 minutes past mid night!

Sat down as normal then only to be told because we have a space next to us next to window we have to move over because the seats behind us have 2 baby’s and they cannot sit together. We said we would happily have them in the window seat but was told no and to move over. What’s the point of paying for seats to then be told you can’t sit where you pay for. Will be actively looking to avoid Wizz air as this hasn’t happened anywhere but this one flight company I have used.

It’s been over four months since I filed it, and despite countless follow-ups, there has been no resolution or payment. The customer service team has been unhelpful, dismissive, and provides no clear answers regarding the delay. This lack of communication and accountability is shocking and frustrating.

As a paying customer, I expected Wizz Air to act with professionalism and respect, especially during a challenging time when I needed support. Unfortunately, their service has caused me nothing but stress. I would not recommend Wizz Air to anyone looking for a reliable airline that takes customer concerns seriously. Based on my experience, they have proven they do not value their customers’ time or trust.

2024-11-14T09:45:21.000Z;DK;THE AIRPLANE STAYED IN THE AIR!;"Flying with Wizz Air is like embarking on a whimsical sky-bound adventure, where every twist is a delightful surprise. The legroom is thoughtfully designed to promote creative yoga poses—who needs a stretching class when you’ve got knees and chin becoming best friends mid-flight? The boarding process is a thrilling social experiment, like a friendly game of musical chairs but with luggage and a sense of urgency.

In-flight, we discovered the charming “aquatic wonderland” bathroom sink—though the fish were clearly too shy to greet us. And despite the nail-biting anticipation from the reviews about “getting away with murder,” we were joyfully disappointed: everyone landed safely, alive, and applauding with the enthusiasm of a standing ovation.";;YES;NO;YES;NO;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We paid for four suitcases in advance and had everything confirmed—payment receipt, email confirmation, and the app itself showed four bags checked in. But when we arrived at the airport, they only had one bag registered in their system. Despite showing all our confirmations, we were forced to pay for the other three suitcases again!

Since this experience in August, we’ve been trying to get our money back. All we receive are automated emails with no real response or acknowledgment of our claim. Wizz Air’s customer service is non-existent, and this experience has shown me they truly do not care about their customers.";;YES;NO;NO;Refund, hidden fees;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Wizzair had a cut off time for online check in for 3 hours despite the industry standard by other low cost carriers being 2 hours. I had booked via a third party (booking.com) and was forced by wizzair to pay a large fee at the airport increasing my total cost by 50%.

";"I booked my ticket with Wizz Air two months in advance, expecting a straightforward travel experience. Instead, I was left stranded in a foreign country with no support or assistance from the airline, feeling anxious and alone in an unfamiliar place. To make matters worse, I was also charged an extra fee just to board my flight!
It’s shocking that, after all the planning, I still faced hidden costs and poor customer service when I needed it the most. This experience left me feeling that Wizz Air cares more about making money than providing any real support for its customers. I hope they address these issues because no one should have to go through this.

2024-11-11T17:40:50.000Z;GB;They charge you for calls now.;I wouldn't give even one star if I could. When browsing for the flights the prices are just changing from minute to minute. I selected WizzSmart and went through all the pages, wanted to pay, but it could not process the payment. So I started again but the price for WizzSmart for the second time was higher! It did not work again. So instead of desktop I used mobile app, again the price was lower this time, I went through all the screens and managed to pay. Immediately I realized I got wrong ticket, just mixed up origin and destination, but the date was good, but of course there is no way to change this even if you will fly anyway, without paying changes fee... and that is ridiculous because people do small mistakes, and it should be allowed to make small changes without being penalized. Finally, I actually paid twice, but if you'd let people change in this kind of situation without fees, you would not lose anything. But this company is obviously one of the greediest in the world and just counts that people will do mistakes. The could probs say that I should have selected the option to get wizz flex, but it's because your website hanging all the time I finally made a mistake. I tried to call the number I got from the chat for the UK passengers, but again it was automated and at the end they have told me to find other number on their website, but the number I used was from the website... so impossible to even talk to anyone. Overall experience the worst like always, all the people I know say only bad things about this greedy company, and me too, it is not first time I experienced problems with them. I hope some regulatory body will finally force them to make changes to their policies in favour for the passengers. Somebody could say just do not fly with them, but really there is not much choice. So happy today I paid for the trip I didn't want, and the trip I wanted. Lost 55 quid just because no way to amend flights without paying fee that normally costs more that the flights... ridiculous.;;YES;YES;NO;NO;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2024-11-08T12:49:06.000Z;NL;Bought the Wizz air annual multiplass…;"I wrote e-mail to WizzAir company but no reaction. I hope posting here will solve the problem.

I am writing to request a refund for the unfair payment for my hand luggage when boarding the plane in Katowice Airport in Poland.
Unfortunately, I am not satisfied with the service for the following reason: I have booked my fly from Eindhoven/Netherland to Katowice/Poland with option only one hand luggage 40cm 30cm 20cm in both way. My hand luggage (soft backpac) with handle is 42cm 20cm 17cm, without handle 40cm 20cm 17cm but still smaller size than required by WizzAir. In Eindhoven my hand luggage according to the service staff didn’t have any reserved, I was not asked to check in the control WizzAir luggage box, it was perfect. While according to the service staff LS Airport Service in Katowice my luggage exceeded the designated dimensions. I was asked to put my hand luggage in control WizzAir luggage box. On the control WizzAir luggage box the picture of the luggage is vertically also the arrow sign is vertically, in this way I put my luggage and fit perfectly. However, the service staff asked me to put my hand luggage horizontally and according the service staff my hand luggage size was not right, that I do not agree.";;YES;NO;NO;NO;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2024-11-07T23:41:38.000Z;GB;Graet value & services;"Not impressed with Wizz Air at all.
We booked as they had decent flight times and reasonable prices. They then make up their lower cost fares with added extras.

I was concerned about being seated away from my kids, but as allocated seating was expensive I opted to pay for auto check-in which is supposed to happen 50 hours prior to departure. I bought this well ahead of travel.

At 50 hours before, it hadn't auto allocated. I called up where they told me they had technical difficulties with it, and asked me to wait and see if it sorted itself overnight.

It didn’t, hence another call the following morning where they basically said ‘it’s not working’, and that I had to claim it back.

I then needed to use standard check-in 24 hours before which, as expected, resulted in us all being in completely different places in the plane. On my return, I tried to claim the auto check in payment back only to be told it’s non refundable, regardless of what happened. How disgraceful to expect l passengers to pay for a service they didn’t deliver!

Asides from that, very late opening of check-in desks, along with long queues so we nearly missed our flight - despite us being at the airport 3 hours before (it opened 2 hours before and was very slow).

On the plane, getting seated was like a circus. One poor kid had something leaking on his head and the cabin crew told him it was ‘a bit of condensation’ and wedged some tissue where it was coming from. Actually transpired to be another passengers leaky Tango in the overhead locker..

Overall we felt it was a stressful experience to travel with Wizz Air - going forward I’d rather pay a bit more and go with a decent company, not these jokers.";;YES;YES;NO;HIdden fees/extra charges;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Be aware they have hidden fees - for example if you do not check in online between 24 and 3 hours before departure, you can only check in at the check-in desk, which will cost you a fee that might be more expensive than the ticket itself. I have never experienced anything like this for any other low-cost airlines and I think it is outrageous.

Imagine 8.5 hours and the only way to get refreshments is to pay a premium. I have an injury requiring wheelchair assistance on arrival. They did not arrange effectively.

2024-10-21T05:20:44.000Z;US;They don’t care about their customers;Absolutely horrible. They are very predatory when it comes to charging extra luggage frees.

Andrea, the manager, along with the blonde, sassy guy, told me I should stop using WizzAir if I question their attitudes. The rest wouldn't give out their names, and threatened that if I film their behavior, they wouldn't allow me on board. Sure, if you have a bigger luggage, you must be charged extra, however, the way they conveyed the message was very militant, disrespectful. We are paying customers and you provide a service!

Sat in airport for further 2 hours with NO communication and not a person in sight who resembled customer service. When we finally found someone they had no idea and blamed other Wizz staff..

Eventually we were ushered into a bus and put up in a hotel at 10pm to be told we had to be up at 330am for a rescheduled flight.. which itself was delayed!

I am here to break that chain and write something good about Wizz air based on my experience last week. Me and my husband travelled to Albania with Wizz air last week. We only took our backpacks as it was a short 3 days. So didn’t have extra luggage to check in. We did online check in 24 hours before the flight using the app, as it didn’t let us check in before that without paid seats. We were allocated 2 seats on opposite sides of the same row but we switched with another couple who were in a similar seating arrangement. So it worked well for both of us. We are not British or EU citizens so after the check in online, we could not print our boarding passes as there was a message to produce our documents at the counter at airport, after reading all the bad reviews I was worried that we might have to pay extra to print boarding passes, but it was not the case, staff at the Wizz counter checked our passport and BRP and printed the boarding passes without us having to pay for it. It was quick and smooth.

On our return journey we could not complete online check in even 24 hours prior to departure without a seat booking, I guess this is a trick they use. Since I read all the bad reviews I knew better than not to just turn up at airport but to pay ?12 per seat and confirm the online check in. its still cheaper to pay for the seats than pay for airport check in. Again, printed the boarding passes at the airport at no cost.

All staff at airports and on board were very nice and helpful. Take offs and landings were surprisingly very smooth, better than some big name airlines to be honest! Only giving 4 stars because of the trick they played on the return journey where we had to pay for seats to continue with our online check in. otherwise everything was great. As well as you could expect of a budget airline.

Also they have all the extra charges listed out on their website, so do your research thoroughly before you book your tickets. And if you don’t have visa requirements, then make sure to print your boarding pass at home and take.

Flight out LTN to TOS, Troms?, Norway.

During flying pilot even pointed out the northern lights for us all and dimmed the lights in cabin so we could all see and take photos

Seats and space fine, no issues whatsoever

So 5 star for that

Docking stars as return was terrible.

Self-service at TOS, fair enough, except no baggage labels would print so ended up queuing with loads of others for an hour to resolve as no Wizz representatives to talk to

Also had to pay ?120 odd for two additional bags.
Desk person at LTN said I could have up to 6 items in my 32kg allowance, but this is apparently wrong it is 6 items allowed per passenger but you have to pay for each individual case?
Eg only one large case of 32kg, can’t check in two cases within that 32kg allowance

Where is the option to do that on app? Baggage upgrade was done on weight, not per item unless I missed something.

I have flown with several low-cost airlines (e.g., EasyJet, Ryanair, Eurowings, Vueling, etc.), and I understand that their business model revolves around secondary services and upsells. However, this is the first time I’ve felt truly misled. The airline’s lack of transparency, particularly regarding service fees, seems like an open attempt to trap passengers with excessive hidden charges that often double the price of the trip.

For example, I received an email on the day of my flight stating, ""Check-in is available 2.5 hours before departure, and up to 1 hour prior."" What it failed to mention is that checking in during this period incurs an additional airport fee. This omission feels deliberate. I’m not alone in this; during my experience, I saw five other passengers—three in a group and a couple—who were caught off guard by the same charge.

If this airline wants to improve its reputation (which is already questionable, based on reviews), it must address customer complaints seriously and be upfront about all fees. Until then, I hope the European Commission for Consumer Rights takes note of this practice and holds the company accountable.

The steward in the back of the plane, who asked me to stand up and show the ticket in Albanian, after several attempts I asked him to have the conversation in English, because I don't speak Albanian.  In a rude and arrogant tone, he told me that I had made a mistake and that I had taken someone else's seat.  I showed him my ticket, on which he wrote the number of the seat I was sitting on.

BA first class on an airbus, same cramped seat pitch as economy and worse than Boeing planes.  The seat pitch is due to the aircraft type rather than operator and since 'thin' seats have been installed Ryanair is the most comfortable of all the carriers.  All airlines have a flying cafe with very few offering free beverages.  The flight delays are mostly due to air traffic control delays over Europe due to staffing levels.  For all those who have posted 'never again' with budget carriers, how was the experience paying 5 times more for the same aircraft painted with a different logo?  And did you actually use the 'free' luggage allowance?  And was the 'free' meal worth the extra price of the seat, typically works out the equivalent of ?50 per sandwich, and ?30 per coffee?

What was supposed to be a simple flight from Bucharest to Paris turned into a nightmare of harassment, intimidation, and unethical overcharging by the WizzAir ground staff.

Whilst we were in queue for the check-in, my family and I were targeted by two extremely rude ground staff members who appeared to have no visible identification badges, and when asked for their names, they mumbled and even tried to cover their badges to remain anonymous. The staff member we believe was named “Alexandra Petra” approached us aggressively, demanding we check the size of our bags. We complied immediately, but as we tried to rearrange our items to make them fit, the hostility escalated.

We were threatened that our belongings would be thrown in the trash if we even attempted to adjust the contents of our bags. When my partner, who had already passed through, came back to check on us, he was aggressively told he had no right to be there or talk with us and was threatened with missing the flight himself. It was an appalling display of abuse of power, and the staff were openly hostile, intimidating, and entirely unprofessional.

What added to the stress and frustration was being coerced into paying for our bags at a supposedly “total” which turned out to be a lie. We were charged more than what we were told the price was, and when questioned, the staff dismissively blamed it on “airport taxes” without any explanation. The lack of transparency was deeply unethical.

To make matters worse, we were told our bags would fit in the overhead cabin, but when we boarded, the overhead compartments were full, and we were forced to store our bags under the seats. Ironically, the bags that allegedly couldn’t fit under the seat (according to the ground staff) fit perfectly, further proving we had been unnecessarily charged.

This experience was beyond unprofessional—it felt discriminatory, as we were treated like nuisances and spoken to as if we were less than human. The sense of xenophobia and disdain was palpable, and I left feeling humiliated and deeply disturbed.

I am a WizzAir Club member, but after this horrifying experience, I will seriously reconsider ever flying with WizzAir again. I demand accountability, an apology, and a full refund for the unjust fees we were forced to pay.

WizzAir, you have lost my trust, and I am appalled by the level of misconduct from your staff. To all potential travelers: BEWARE of the abusive treatment at the hands of this airline’s staff.

Why wizz air wouldn't let the customers know the delays in adance ? As they know for sure they will delay their flights !
Connecting flights, booked bus tickets,train tickets and ferry tickets all paid for nothing. This is not acceptable but what can you do.
The system allows wizz air to abuse their customers and they love doing that .

Do your self a favour and avoid this pathetic company.

When arrived at the gate I've heard people and the staff particularly one female staff were shouting quite loudly. As they were forcing every single passenger to fit their backpacks in the metal frame right before the plane and charging people 54 pounds!
So when it was my turn they also forced and threaten me with not letting me in the plane! I've asked several times that instead of apologising and explaining the reason for the 2 and half hours delay why charging people 54 pounds for the backpacks been slightly large and the extremely rude staff kept saying ""she doesn't work for wizz air and it's not her problem '
Believe it was vicious and uncivilised! So I managed to fit my soft fabric backpack in heir metal frame but it was 8cm taller than 40cm but allthough I had 1pkg allowance my bag was only 7kg but she still charged me 54 pounds!

I then spoke to customer services who were apologetic and said they would arrange for the credits to be provided.

Again, the credits were not provided so I filed a complaint - in response to which the airline said that as I cancelled the flights (on the date I spoke to customer services, so presumably cancelled by the agent I spoke to) I would not be entitled to any form of refund.

Wizz Air, you are a DISGRACE to the airline industry! *Yet again*, you cancelled our flight at the very last minute, completely throwing our entire trip into chaos. This isn’t the first time you’ve pulled this stunt, but it WILL be the last time we ever book with you. We were left stranded, panicked, and helpless because of your sheer incompetence.

Thanks to you, we missed our connecting flight, and not just any flight—it was our ONLY chance to reach an important destination! The financial loss, the stress, the endless hours of trying to rebook everything... utterly unbearable. You have no concept of customer service or basic human decency. No help, no explanation, just a robotic “your flight is cancelled” like that somehow makes up for ruining our entire journey!

Wizz Air, you are the definition of a nightmare. It’s like you take pleasure in creating misery for your passengers. If you want your vacation, your work trip, or any shred of peace of mind DESTROYED, then sure, go ahead and book with these clowns. Otherwise, RUN the other way as fast as you can.

2024-10-08T16:08:05.000Z;AE;Wizz Air. Only about the money!;"I recently endured a harrowing journey with Wizz Air from Baku to Abu Dhabi. The flight was plagued by delays, with little to no communication from the airline. When I did complain at the airport, I was told all updates are delivered through their app.

Given Wizz Air's ability to send emails regarding luggage charges and check-in, it is astonishing that they would rely solely on an app for delay notifications. This is especially problematic for those who may not have access to their phones or may have unreliable internet connections.

Despite Wizz Air's own policy of providing adequate food and water during delays, the options offered were utterly insufficient. As a vegetarian, I was only offered a hot dog and water. This is unacceptable, especially considering European Regulation 261/2004 requires airlines to provide appropriate food and drink during delays.

Wizz Air's customer service is equally as appalling. The only way to file a complaint is through their predetermined form, which offers no room for adequate explanation or context. When I inquired about other channels for complaints, such as social media or email, I was informed that there is no such option. This is a blatant disregard for customer welfare.

I strongly advise anyone considering flying with Wizz Air to reconsider. Their utter disregard for passenger welfare and complete lack of customer service make them an airline to avoid at all costs.";;YES;YES;NO;NO;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Op de harde stoelen na (en het applaudisseren van de passagiers bij de landing, ik wist niet dat dat nog bestond en is Wizz Air niet te verwijten) kan ik HELEMAAL NIETS NEGATIEFS zeggen over Wizz Air:
1. online boeking (website) ging zeer eenvoudig, en bij het later bijboeken van extra bagage via de app (en naast elkaar zitten en automatische check-in) bleek de naadloze integratie van website en app.
2. stiptheid dik in orde: op de heenreis 20 minuten te laat vertrokken en netjes op tijd aangekomen, op de terugreis stipt op tijd vertrokken en 35 minuten te vroeg aangekomen.
3. bagageafhandeling voorbeeldig, beide keren maar 10 minuten hoeven wachten, dus relaxed de tijd voor een toiletstop en daarna vlot naar de uitgang.
4. vriendelijk personeel en schoon vliegtuig en toilet.

Ik ben 1,77m en had voldoende beenruimte.  Volgende keer neem ik een stoelkussentje mee.


Fortunately, I had not read all the bad and hostile reviews beforehand, otherwise I definitely would not have booked for a vacation flight Eindhoven-Varna (14-21 October 2024).  But thank goodness I only read all that afterwards.

Except for the hard seats (and the applauding of the passengers at landing, I didn't know that still existed and can't be blamed on Wizz Air) I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE about Wizz Air:
1. Online booking (website) was very easy, and when later adding extra luggage via the app (and sitting next to each other and automatic check-in) the seamless integration of website and app proved to be very good. 
2. Punctuality was excellent: on the outbound flight we left 20 minutes late and still arrived right on time, on the return flight we left right on time and arrived 35 minutes early.
3. Baggage handling was flawless, both times we only had to wait 10 minutes, so relaxed time for a toilet stop and then smoothly through to the exit.
4. Friendly staff and clean airplane and toilet.

In Addition the Turkish desk attendant, was offering to take small suitcases in for free of charge, I had my wife and child flying out the next week as I had to leave sooner, so I told them they can take their slightly larger small suitcase and drop the bag off. Turns out it's a pick and choose from these attendants. We paid extra, but never trust a word they say, rely on the website info.

We had to pay for one of the girls' backpacks, which didn't have any problems at Lisboa and we also had to pay another €53 for the 10kg luggage (which we had already paid €103 when purchasing the flights). The information on the website is not clear regarding this luggage and misleads the customer. Furthermore, in Lisbon we didn't have any problems with this luggage. They could send an email specifying that this 10kg luggage cannot go with us and that it would have to be placed in the hold. I think once the customer buys it, they could be more specific.

The service counter refused to check me in and then refused to provide me a re-routing option and after some convincing they offered us to be STAND-BY at the gate where we waited until the last moment to actually board the plane waiting like orphaned kids at the gate.

I want to add that when I was discussing with the airport personnel at the check-in desk, he informed us that with Wizz Air this overbooking is very very common, so literally a ticket with them is like a lottery ticket.

We paid for 2 tickets 710 euro (350 and 360 euros because Wizz Air cannot sell 2 tickets at the same price!). And as it wasn't expensive enough, we also got a fine because we didn't buy 'priorty tickets'. So other 58 euros each, meaning other 116 euros, paid at the airport: Wizz Air wants you to have a backpack even if you carry a big stone rather than a small troller (backpack-size) and both half empty. It also delayed the take off with 2 hours so that we all get hungry and thursty, so that they can sell their chpis, crackers, etc. I asked for a free cup of coffee and the young lady (whose salary is paid from our tickets!) turned her back on me. For the record, Wizz coffee is some instant coffee dissolved in hot water-nothing special (unless you wait the take off for hours!). In such situation, I think each passanger deserves at least a bottle of water free of charge. Furthermore, I think low cost companies must have a maximum price that they must be allowed to charge in order to be called 'low cost'. Otherwise, having paid over 700 euros, having got a fine of over 100 euros, and travelling next to pasangers who only paid +/-50 euros (and no fine!) is DISCRIMINATION for whatever reasons that make no sense to me, although it may make sense to Wizz.;;yes;yes;no;high price;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2024-09-12T10:23:43.000Z;GR;Lack of professionalism on check in;On September 11, at Heraklion Airport in Crete, Greece, I accompanied a disabled friend on their flight from Heraklion to Bucharest, which was scheduled to depart at 9:20 p.m.    Unfortunately, the experience was marked by a lack of organization.    There is no designated desk for wheelchair assistance and we had to wait until check-in opened two hours before departure.   The main problem was the unavailability of a wheelchair.    When one was finally found the check in agent was extremely rude.    Despite the fact that the need for assistance was clearly stated on the ticket, she asked us in detail about the nature of my friend's disability.    After waiting another 30 minutes for the wheelchair, the agent refused to give priority to my friend, even though this is standard procedure for passengers with disabilities.    Instead, she insisted on serving others in line who did not have mobility issues.   The check-in agent threatened to delay us further if we continued to ask questions, which she eventually did.    In all my experience with airports, I have never encountered a situation where a disabled passenger is not given priority.   The blonde lady at check-in showed a clear lack of professionalism and understanding of boarding procedures.    In our opinion, she is not suited for the role and would greatly benefit from additional training.   I am deeply disappointed with Wizz Air and it seems that the service with this airline continues to deteriorate.;;yes;YES;YES;issues with helping disabled customer;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I've had the misfortune of flying 4/5x with them and every time has been awful.

I've never known an airline to be so unreliable. All my flights have been delayed.

The last one was 50 minutes.. supposedly. So I clicked 'accept' We ended up being 2 hours delayed which messed up my plans. If I had known I could have declined it and accepted a different flight with another provider.

Every single journey has felt like we weren't going to make it to our destination.

The lack of organisation and planning is beyond me.

Latest flight:
We were all sat down. A member of the team told us to get up and queue. We stood still for 45 minutes when we could have been sat down. Then we did boarding.

The shuttles came to get us. But at this point priority and non priority were mixed up and they paid a premium for what?

No apologises no explanation.

We were then stood on the shuttles cramped and unable to move for about 20 minutes.

Then it was a free for all to get on the plane.

Again..sat on the tarmac for ages and finally left nearly 2 hours after scheduled. Bear in mind they said 1 hour delay and didn't update it after that.

Then a few of us missed our connecting flight. And funnily enough that one departed 5 minutes early.

I will never ever fly with wizz air again. Every time has been awful. It's almost like they get the rejects from other airlines to work for them, I don't understand it.

2024-09-23T17:30:56.000Z;EG;Complaint Regarding Handbag Issue and…;"Complaint Regarding Handbag Issue and Poor Service Experience on Flight 7018

Dear Wizz Air Customer Service,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service I received during my recent travel with Wizz Air. Today, on flight 7018 from Alexandria to Abu Dhabi, I encountered an issue regarding my handbag at the airport, which was handled in a very unprofessional and disappointing manner by the desk attendant.

The attendant was unhelpful and exhibited a poor attitude when I raised my concerns. Instead of offering assistance, they responded with hostility and a lack of understanding, which only added to my frustration. This is not the standard of service I expect from your airline, and certainly not how customers should be treated.

I was informed that my bag weighed about 10 kg and needed to be reduced to 7 kg. I complied and made the necessary adjustments to bring the weight down to 7 kg. However, despite meeting the weight requirement, the attendant still refused to allow me to take the bag on board without providing any valid reason. After contacting some friends with connections at the airport, I was informed that I should have been allowed to take the bag onboard without any issue. This inconsistency in enforcing policies raises serious concerns.

I kindly request that Wizz Air address this matter promptly, clarify the handbag policy, and investigate the behavior of the staff at the desk. This kind of experience should not be repeated for other passengers.

I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.";;YES;NO;NO;luggage problem, no clear policy;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2024-09-08T13:39:00.000Z;AE;Baggage lost;"Absolutely Terrible Experience with Wizzair – Lost Baggage and Insulting Compensation Offer

Our flight with Wizzair on September 4th from Madina to Abu Dhabi turned into an absolute nightmare. Upon landing, we discovered that Wizzair had lost our baggage – a shocking failure on their part that has caused us immense stress and inconvenience.

However, what made this ordeal even worse was their response. After days of waiting for updates, Wizzair finally informed us that the baggage is permanently lost. Instead of offering real compensation for this major mistake, they added insult to injury by offering only 50% compensation, but only if we can provide receipts for everything we lost! This is beyond ridiculous and utterly unacceptable.

How are we supposed to have receipts for all our personal belongings, some of which are irreplaceable? This policy is completely unreasonable and feels like a way to dodge responsibility. Wizzair’s lack of accountability is infuriating, and the fact that they think this is a fair solution is unreasonable.

The whole situation has left us incredibly frustrated and disappointed in Wizzair’s handling of the issue. This is not how you treat customers, and it’s certainly not the level of service anyone should expect from an airline.

If you care about your belongings and peace of mind, I strongly advise against flying with Wizzair. Their carelessness and refusal to adequately compensate for their own mistakes show they have no regard for their passengers.

Wizzair, this is not good enough. We deserve proper compensation and a lot more respect than what you’ve shown us.";;YES;NO;NO;lost luggage, no real compensation, terrible way of handling the situation;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I have enjoyed flying so many times with Whizz Air however this time I had a very bad experience.

While the three of us were in naples airport waiting to board the flight, one of your company employees a lady with black glasses and black hair in a ponytail stopped first me and then my parents because we had duty free bags from the airport.

I explained that having read your instructions on the Whizz Air website that duty free purchases in the Airport bags are not charged extra and we always had a bag from the airport in any flight I did previously without any problem I was surprised that she was challenging us and willing to ignore the information on the Whizz Air website.

The company employee decided not listen to me and was very rude, and even physically pushed my mom away and asked us to put everything in our bag. I couldn't fit anything in my backbag so I asked kindly his colleague, a tall gentleman, that was a very polite person, how much was the charge if I want to take the duty free bags on the plane, and he told me 8€ per bag.
Both my parents and I confirmed with this gentleman that the charge was 8€ per bag.
However when my dad was paying by card we saw the amount of 174€.
I mentioned to her that her colleague told all three of us that it was 8€. And the girl with black hair insisted he was wrong and it’s 58€.
I explained to the lady that my father is disabled and should not shout at him and be aggressive.
My dad had an anxiety attack because of how aggressive and loud she was, feeling verbally abused and intimidated, by this situation, luckily he had his pills with him.
I am not only concerned about the money, I am upset about not respecting other people, and people who the company employees have been informed may be vulnerable, disabled and are weaker than them.
Together with my parents the three of us are very upset at how we were treated and a failure by a Whizz Air employee to treat their customers in a legal and ethical manner.

I believe that this matter needs to be properly investigated by your company as we understand that we can go to the small claims court if the company does not address this matter in a manner that is appropriate and satisfactory to us.";;yes;no;no;no;no;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Dear Wizz Air Customer Service,

I am writing to express my frustration and disappointment regarding an incident on September 11, 2024, at Malta International Airport. My friend and I were passengers on flight W4 2804, with a connection in Austria, and our final destination being Georgia. Unfortunately, we were denied boarding by your ground staff despite having all necessary documentation.

As UK residents with indefinite leave to remain, we are not required to have an additional visa for transit through Austria, which is confirmed by the relevant consular authorities. I presented this official information to your staff, yet they refused to acknowledge it and unjustifiably denied us boarding. This lack of knowledge and unwillingness to assist us properly is unacceptable.

Not only did this cause significant inconvenience and financial loss, but it also demonstrated a worrying lack of understanding by your staff regarding basic transit and visa regulations. I request that this matter be investigated, and appropriate actions be taken to ensure this does not happen to other passengers in the future.

I look forward to receiving your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution to this issue.

Kind regards,

This has caused a lot of stress and i ended up paying for extra services. On the way to Venice we had no issues doing the online check-in, but on the way back it was impossible to check in online. I have double checked my email and the booking details to make sure it was not a mistake from my side, i have even tried to do the online check-in from a different device such as a tablet, a laptop, another phone but it was still unsuccessful. No matter what we tried we just couldn't finish the check in. At the section with the passenger passport details i could fill in everyone's information except for my daughter's details. The issues was that it wouldn't allow me to select her date of birth, the year wouldn't go higher than 2010. I've downloaded the wizz air app thinking that it would help. I never experienced this type of problem before and i didn't know what to do. I've tried to contact wizz air customer service but that was also impossible . The chat box assistant and the customer service number was unavailable. We also tried to scan her passport rather than putting her details manually and that as well gave error saying that the passport is invalid. Once desperate, i decided to pay for the autocheck-in service not knowing that once i pay, i will still have the same issue. As a last option i decided to pay for the airport check-in service but that was again useless, as i still had to fill in the passport details and was still not able to select the correct birth year. At first, I believed that maybe it was because when we went to Venice my daughter was 11 years old and on our way back from Venice back home she had already turned 12. But that couldn't have been the case since that goes automatically when you have to select the child's age and fill in the personal details the moment you do the booking for the flight. Also, whenever i purchased the extra services such as autocheck-in and airport check-in, i had to pay for the whole family, even though the problem was only for one of them. I ended up spending extra ??? due to some technical issues, and that had nothing to do with my booking or my daughter's passport. Luckily, when we arrived at the airport the lady at the check in desk she was able to help us check-in. When I wrote in to try to get back the money that I payed extra, their response was like a copy-paste version of their ""helping customer guide"" which gave me the feeling that my email wasn't even read fully. Basically I paid extra because of their technical issue and never got a refund from them, or at least a decent response. I even ended up calling them on their 800 number (which is not cheap) and still for nothing.
This company is a complete JOKE.
To top it up, on our way back from Venice to London I was charged extra for my luggage ( the same luggage we went with from London to Venice and it was all good then) . Their excuse was that my bag was to big and it was supposed to be checked in. I was even told that there is no space on the plane for my bag anyhow, that the plane was full. When boarding the plane I realised that there were more than 30 empty spaces. Im guessing that because they didn't made enough sales for their flight they started charging passengers for their bags,... they had to get their money from somewhere. I was definitely not the only one that was charged for their bags that day.
A bunch of sneaky, rude and unprofessional, that have no consideration for parents with small children, pregnant women or anyone else.

I booked flights in 2020. Due to corona they have been cancelled. Wizz offered 20% added value if not refunded but put on ""Wizz Club Account"". I did so. Booked another flight later. Due to significant schedule change I had to cancel again. After corona then last year I wanted to use MY credit which was around 400,- Euro which I had actually PAID to Wizz before and the 20% value they added.

But : my account was : 0,00 !! My credit was """"""""""expired"""""""""". FULLY ! Even my payment to them !!

I am asking you : HOW CAN THAT BE ??

Well if they would have expired the 20% they added before, we may discuss if this acceptable or not.

But an AMOUNT that I have already paid to Wizz ??

HOW ON EARTH CAN IT EVER EXPIRE ?!?!?!??!?!?

It would be like you have money on a bank account but you leave it there for some time and one day the bank tells you : BYE BYE your money is gone because you did not use it !!!

THATS NOTHING ELSE THAN F R A U D and T H E F T because my own money can never ever expire !!!

Neither did they at any time tell me : attention your ""credit"" will expire !!! Nor did I agree in their terms that I would have had to use it within 1 year...

They are criminals !!

And that is exactly the reason for their newest idea of a ""flight flatrate"" or whatever !!

I can ONLY WARN everybody out there !!

Thats nothing but a cheap funds procurement and you may NEVER EVER SEE YOUR MONEY AGAIN !!

Because there is still illness I have to book a flight with the Flex option so that I can later rebook this flight to another flight. etc. note Flex costs extra money. After I booked a new flight, Wizz Air cancelled this flight and the amount was put back on my account. People who paid via the bank get their money back but I have to book a new flight within a year.

The FAQ and AI bot were obviously of no use, so we decided to call the Wizzair helpdesk at a paid number. It took around ten minutes to speak to someone, even although we were the third caller. It turned out that there was no payment issue, but they had changed our reserved seats.

In the end, I have had to make a 12 EUR phonecall for an error on their part, and for a 50 EUR flight. That's a 20% price increase you got there!

Afterwards, Wizzair refused to cover the bill, citing terms and conditions that do not apply. We are now trying to get them to pay anyway, out of principle. They could potentially abuse this system to overbook flights. Someone not fluent in English or quick with their computer would have been stranded.

Wait for it, once all on, no fuel! Once that was rectified, no slot for take off!

It feels incredibly unfair to loyal customers who book early to be penalized with higher prices, while last-minute buyers get a significant discount. This pricing policy is misleading and disrespectful to those of us who trust the airline enough to book in advance. I expected better transparency and fairness from Wizz Air.

2024-08-23T12:57:31.000Z;AU;6 hours later… still waiting to board.;"Wizz Air is the biggest scam of an airline I have ever encountered.
On 31/07/2023, a flight booked through Wizz Air from Milan - Jeddah (the first leg of my trip) was delayed by 1.5 hours, meaning that the 2.5 hour layover time in the airport was cut way too short, and after transferring airports, purchasing a transfer visa, collecting luggage and re-registering it, and going through security at the other end, the next leg of the flight was well and truly missed. It wasn't just myself in this situation - roughly 30 other travellers were affected by this delay.
However, when booking with Wizz Air, I had not only paid for flight cancellation or delay protection, but also a 'self transfer guarantee', meaning that if one leg of the flight was delayed causing me to miss the next leg, then I had the option of either a refund for the first flight, a flight for the rest of there trip organised by the airline, or a flight back to my original destination. As soon as I knew I had to rebook, I tried to call the airline and AirHelp (the site for customer service I was directed to contact by their website) but had no-one pick up for 45 minutes. I then sent an email to AirHelp, but did not receive a reply for 18 hours. During this time, I was stranded alone in Jeddah airport with no other way of contacting the airline, and then had to fork out $2100 for another 2 flights to get me back to Perth, Australia. I instantly lodged a claim to have my flight reimbursed, thinking that as outlined and promised in the policy, I would get my money back. However Wizz refund me for the first leg of the flight, and refused to pay any more. I was left $1500 out of pocket for their mistake, plus the cost of airport food over the course of 24 hours that I had been stranded there - another cost that was promised to be reimbursed in the case of a flight delay. I have now been emailing and calling the company for an entire year, receiving slow, unhelpful replies, after submitting every peace of supporting documentation required to make my case, reciting their own policies back to them and being told I was correct, but they still could not process my request. I've still been neglected in terms of response, am now taking legal action.

Instead of receiving the refund, my flight was canceled! and the customer service was extremely arrogant and unhelpful. Their dismissive attitude and refusal to address the issue properly have left me very disappointed.

This time it was Flight N W6 2093 from Krakow to Abudhabi 17.08.2024.
We booked our tickets many months ago and our seats were 7B and 7C.
But, first of all, girl which was trying to serves us in registration ( her place was N33) forgot to give us boarding passes! Wow! So pleasant staff. Wonder, how we should go to plane without it.
Secondly and this is our main complaint, she gave us another seats. 9B and 7D, to made us separate with sister. Also, I registered us few days before, no changing in our seats was in website.
When we started complaining, she laying to us that Wizzair changed plane in last minute and that's why all seats were changing. False, because we asked flight attendance and they told us, no one change the plane.
If she told us, that sometimes system may change places it's fine, but what the reason to told a false? Also, she took our Ukrainian passports and asked if we speak Ukrainian?
Please, may you provide special training for your staff and teach them that usually all nationalities are speaking with their native language. She didn't want to tell us what's happened and just send us to Wizzair station in Krakow Airport to speak man which was free but rude when spoke with us.
In plane we noticed that no one have problems with seats. Only we. Unfair a little bit, we booked, payed and registered in our booking seats, so why your system changes only our places?
We don't want to sit near men or crying child. We want to sit together, we are family, but you give our seats to another people.
Next time make a fun, change seats for everyone.

What happened :
I travelled from Paris to nearby European city, with 1 stopover in another European city. When I arrived my stopover city, the airplane arrived 45 minutes late so I missed the next flight to my final destination.

The personnel of Wizzair, literally ignored me on my face when I was trying to talk to them.
I tried English, French, Spanish in all fluency but they IGNORED me.
Hence I could get absolutely zero information about connecting flight ir alternative flight option. I was in a state of shock but had to rebook the flight at the gate of arrival where I just had landed.

Absolutely no help and no sense of customer support.

If you have any similar experience like mine, I would recommend you to get a lawyer as they are a lot of lawyers used to deal with Wizz Air without a lawyer, Wizzair even do not reply customer reclaim forms.

2024-08-15T08:37:45.000Z;GB;Taking Legal Action Against Wizz Air for Scamming Practices;"My sister was due to travel with her daughter to Malaga on 28 June 2024. She was cleared at passport control and after a lengthy delay was denied boarding as the name on the ticket was different to the name on her passport. Her passport photo clearly indicated that she was one and the same person.

We provided WizzAir with a legal document clearly stating that she is also known by the name in which her flight had been booked.

The way she was treated and threatened with eviction from the airport beggars belief. She was treated like a criminal because her names did not correspond. I was called @ 9.30pm to go and collect a very distressed and anxious sister (who has had major life saving surgery and could have done without this awful experience) from Gatwick Airport which is 1hr 30mins from where I live.

Her daughter who booked her mother’s flight realised immediately at the time of booking that she had booked the ticket in the derivative form of her mum’s name and tried to amend this, but the website would not allow her to do this.

My sister has yet to receive further updates about her claim, other than an offer for settlement and asking for her bank details which was made on 16 July 2024. She provided the details requested, but her response was not acknowledged. None of our many follow on emails requesting an update, have been acknowledged either.

You cannot get any answers from the customer service team who advise you they cannot give you an update on your complaint.

Since that time, over the past week, I have repeatedly called and emailed WIZZ AIR, requesting the reinstatement of the initial booking I paid for or, at the very least, a review of the recorded conversation to verify the misleading information provided by their employee. I would like to emphasize that, had I been properly informed, I would never have voluntarily canceled the flights, knowing it would result in such a significant financial loss.;;YES;NO;NO;NO;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Second: It took 3hrs on the ground for them to refuel. This should be achievable in 40 minutes maximum.

We had options at check-in where we could leave items or bags behind. She told us point blank that that was how Wizz Air makes money.   She charged us over ?200 for the 4 bags and then put tags on the wrong bag, which was  one of the smallest one.  The  children carrying one of the bags went through and when we tried to go through she charged ?54 again for the same suitcase despite that they made an error in the tagging.  We were fleeced and felt very vulnerable. What surprised us is that they had targeted just our family and yet other people with similar bags without priority tags were marching past her.  Her focus was just on us.  If this was fair treatment then every one of the passengers with similar luggage  should have been subjected to that treatment.

2024-08-24T11:26:40.000Z;CY;My review is ZERO;"Our family had booked a holiday. We booked return flights with Wizz Air. We booked both outbound and inbound flights together, hence, I have a single bank transaction (and you’d expect to have a single booking) but they emailed me two separate bookings: one for the inbound flight and one for the outbound flight. This is important later.

The flight to our holiday destination was cancelled by Wizz Air on the day - we waited 3 hours in the plane on the tarmac. We decided to rebook our flights but that was a nightmare…

The Wizz Air representative back at the airport wasn’t giving us any useful information on how to rebook our flights. She didn’t even give us food vouchers which airlines are meant to in case of a cancelled flight. She just kept saying to buy food and water and book a hotel near the airport and to claim it back later through their website. We, therefore, decided to contact Wizz Air to rebook the flights. That was a nightmare too…

Wizz Air either doesn't provide or doesn’t have a customer service email and they don’t have live chat on their website either (only a chat where a robot gives generic answers, not a customer service agent). Therefore, the only way to contact Wizz Air is to call - but calling isn’t free. What else could we do? We called. At the beginning of the call it said the wait time was 100 and something minutes. We decided to wait but it randomly disconnected. We tried again and the same thing happened - bear in mind we had waited 10-15 minutes each time and paid for each of those minutes. We tried on several phones but there was no difference. The next day, we tried again but weren’t getting anywhere so we made the tough decision to cancel the holiday and get our money back. This was also a nightmare.

I did some research and found that airlines are obligated to refund customers both outbound and inbound flights if their outbound flight was cancelled. This meant I was obligated a full refund of both flights BUT this is only the case if you bought both flights on the SAME booking. As I said earlier, I booked the flights together but Wizz Air made it two separate bookings meaning they were only obligated to give me a refund for the outbound flight and not the inbound flight. That’s very wrong. On another note, when I logged into my account on their website to request a refund for the cancelled flight, it wouldn’t show up. Eventually, a few weeks later it did show up but it had already been converted into Wizz Air credit (one of the other options instead of a refund). There was an option to convert it back to a full refund but this, again, wasn’t working.

Eventually, I got so fed up of the entire situation, I just went on my mobile banking, found the transaction and disputed it. 5 weeks later, I got my money back for the cancelled flight only. Lucky, I also got my money back from the hotel.

The abismal customer service I experienced and the illegal tactics Wizz Air uses means I will never book anything with Wizz Air again, no matter how cheap. The stress isn’t worth it.";;YES;NO;NO;Extra fees, cancellation;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

My 15 year old nephew had a very nice holiday in Lithuania until I had brought him to the terminal and he arrived at the gate. There a stewardess started shouting at him that he had to give his passport while he had already done so, she found out 10 minutes later. Then a steward on the plane said that his suitcase was too big and did not fit in the compartment. He had to pay an extra 54 euros. The poor boy did not have that with him, then they said that his suitcase was not allowed. He called his mother in tears, but she could not get the staff on the phone, they did not have time for that. Fortunately there was a very nice fellow passenger who paid the amount for him. Then the man took the suitcase and it turned out to fit easily in the compartment, the man then asked for and received his 54 euros back.

2024-08-02T11:43:51.000Z;ES;First and last time travelling with…;"I DO NOT RECOMMEND WIZZ AIR: The experience with the outward flight to Bucharest (from Madrid) was quite chaotic. The billing staff is very very slow (it took the same 15 minutes with a passenger who was taking a tram), due to various problems and things that did not appear in the system (and the client had paid). Then, to board the plane they are slow, disorderly and chaotic... creating a really unpleasant situation. If you are old, have problems/go with a cane, or are pregnant they just don't care. There is no concept of priority. Well... if it exists, they charge you for a ""prioriti"" service that is supposed to get you on the plane before everyone else... but since it includes a trolley-type suitcase to carry in the cabin, everyone pays for it. With which the concept of priority is diluted and all the people get on the plane in a rush. Compared to other airlines, they are a disaster.
Now we go to the return trip (Bucharest-Madrid), which was unpleasant, disastrous and I would almost say bordering on ""SCAM"". First you should know that if you can check-in online, YOU SHOULD DO IT. Otherwise, at the airport they will charge you €45 per passenger to check in at the counter (any airline does it for free, since it is a service, a way to control the access of the ticket and also know ""who "" Flying). However, on the WIZZ AIR website it clearly says that if they do not have the online check-in service open for your flight, THEY CANNOT CHARGE YOU a cent. On the outward journey from Madrid this was the case. But, BUCHAREST is another world and as long as they can take advantage... well they will.
The fact is that our return flight, without any prior notice, changed airports and instead of leaving from their international airport, it left from a civil airport that is in the city. Needless to say, at the international airport no one had any idea about anything and it was impossible for them to inform us of anything. Finally we got someone to help us with the information. The race begins to get to the other airport by taxi, in a city that is clogged all day by traffic jams... we manage to get there. And when we arrived at the check-in counter we found that the flight (for reasons I don't know) was operated by another airline and as the case was, we would have to pay those €45 billing per person... we are a family of 3, so if we wanted to get on the plane we had to spend €135. The excuse was ""online check-in"", but since you are sold and if you don't pay you are stuck there, you have to jump through the hoop. A FRAUD. The curious thing is that it was the only flight that was operated that day at the airport, and the same two employees who checked in were the ones who later controlled the passengers getting on the plane. The flight left 1 hour late because of all this. We are complaining about this to WIZZ AIR, but I simply DO NOT RECOMMEND FLYING WITH THEM.

Firstly, they put me on standby and left me waiting at Luton airport, not knowing if I would be able to make my business trip. There were 10 of us put on standby because they had overbooked the flight. It was only when me and the 9 other passengers got to the gate that we were told that there was space and we could board. The outbound flight was also delayed by over an hour. I booked priority tickets both ways that came at additional costs. Surely nothing could go wrong on my return flight .. right?? I checked in online prior to arriving at Budapest airport to find out that Wizz had changed my priority boarding to standard which limited how much hand held luggage I could take on the plane. This resulted in me paying additional fees at the gate to carry on 2 bags that I have previously paid for. They said I can take this up with Wizz air once I’m back but if I wanted to take both bags on the plane, I needed to pay the additional costs. What more can go wrong right?! They boarded us on time (can you believe) to be told once were we on the plane, that the flight would be delayed by over 2 hours because there’s lots of planes in the air.

2024-07-31T17:00:49.000Z;BE;Worst in Europe;"I had an awful experience with absolutely zero help from the customer service. I booked a flight and needed to make a change within 24 hours of booking the flight. Usually, there is a policy on most airlines that if you make an amend, they will help you free of charge. This was not the case with me and I was charged a ?40 amendment fee. When making the change, the site timed out and when this happened and I re-booked, the date was incorrect. I called Wizzair WITHIN LESS THAN TWO HOURS to ask them to help me make the amend and they have charged me again with absolutely no empathy to a mistake being made. The customer service was rude and hung up on me. This has been an awful experience booking a flight for my birthday and is definitely an airline I will avoid using in the future. It is just a money-grabbing company with absolutely no empathy or customer support.

The Department of Transportation has a long-standing policy that requires airlines to provide free changes to consumers within 24 hours of purchasing, so long as a ticket is bought at least seven days before a flight. Wizzair will not offer you even 2 hours grace.

Also, please note, if you do take your complaint to Twitter, you will be helped nearly immediately by a very friendly customer support team from a scam account pretending to be WizzAir.

On Sunday 28/07 my daughter was denied boarding her plane at Luton airport on her flight to Bourgas because the Wizz flight was deliberately overbooked. She had done everything correctly, her flight was booked and paid for in August 2023, she checked in online as per the Wizzair policy and was at the check in desk at the airport 3 hours prior to her flight to check in her luggage.

She had to go through the whole procedure only to be told at the boarding gate that she could not get on the plane as they had overbooked the flight.

She subsequently went to the handling desk at the airport and requested a full refund and had to book another flight from Gatwick with Balkan later that day. Initially she asked to get put on the next Wizz flight out to Bourgas the following day but was told this was already overbooked by 10 people! So other unsuspecting travellers were no doubt subjected to the same ordeal the next day.

To her surprise, this money has not been refunded but instead she has been booked onto the next available Wizz flight on 31/07. This was not what she requested nor is this shown on the paperwork given to her at the airport.

Despite several phone calls on Monday to Wizz customer services this has still not been resolved and she has been told that she needs to submit a complaint online.

Needless to say, this has been a very traumatic experience for her as a young woman with little experience of travelling alone.

Dear Mr Varadi

I know you will not read this post, as non of your staff seem to bother replying. My first trip with Wizzair was a disaster. The journey from Vienna to London Gatwick, was by your airline‘s standards a success, the delay in landing was only one hour. Congrats!

The return journey on the other hand was anything but WIzZ. At check in, one person operating the desk for around 250 passengers. An sms at 1430 warned,of a 3 Hour delay for a flight leaving at 1930. No corrective action possible I suppose.

No one at the Menzies desk to answer questions, no one answering the phone. Passengers left completely in the dark as were others trying to get to Milan and Naples. Boarded at 2330 took off at 2400 , just a cursory apology. Arrived in Vienna at 0240 got home at 0400.

Completed the complaint process via Wizzair only to be told that after that „after thoroughly investigating“ my case the delay was the result of air traffic issues, known about 5 hours before the due take off time.

Furthermore Wizzair has provided no proof which you are obliged to do according to 261/2004 of the European regulation, a quote your airline guidelines provided me with.


I will be taking this matter further with a claims agent which your airline is very keen customers do not do.

With this level of service you are unlikely ever to see a ?100mn bonus again.

Because this did not just cost money and a lot of time, but it was a 20 hour overnight delay to a working day where I could not show up.

THIS IS STEALING FROM YOUR CUSTOMER. should make this clear before you book with thwm, not to show you picture with bag and claim that the bag is the only one you can carry free in the cabin. I will ask them to pay my luggage as it was left on airport. And as I know that they are sooo rude with reason and thay are inpunishable , I hope YOU DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM OR TO BE READY TO STAY WITHOUT BAG.

2024-07-22T15:38:18.000Z;FR;;This is the worst airline Service i have experienced in any country. Denied boarding due to overbooking of flight, charged 96 Euros for checkin at the airport just for airport checkin, kept us waiting for 3 hours just to talk about rebooking options and even then all the staff women were very rude and unhelpful. Avoid this airline if you want to save yourself from this kind of experience.

2024-07-22T10:15:23.000Z;IE;;"Avoid this company. I decided not to fly with them and requested a refund, as I had purchased WIZZ Flex with my tickets. After calling customer service and spending money on the call, my issue was not resolved. Initially, I was told I was not eligible for a refund, but after repeatedly mentioning that I had WIZZ Flex, they still couldn’t help and advised me to file an online complaint for a refund. The response to my complaint stated that I was not eligible for a refund.

I want to advise everyone not to buy go-and-return tickets together. I couldn’t cancel my flight because I had used the first flight segment. The customer service is the worst I’ve experienced, even worse than Ryanair. It's impossible to contact them through chat, and phone calls result in no positive outcomes.

I also had another problem with the same flight. I bought my tickets three months in advance and, not being a UK resident, I also purchased a connecting flight. A few weeks later, I received an email stating that the scheduled time had changed to 8 hours earlier, forcing me to rebook my connecting flight. I would arrive in the UK later than my new flight to the final destination. I filed an online complaint and requested reimbursement for the rebooked ticket but was denied. I also contacted ODR with no success.

Additionally, their virtual assistant, Amelia, is useless. When you ask to be connected to live agents, she directs you to call customer service instead.

This organization is very unhelpful. I will avoid this company in the future, even if their tickets are very cheap.";;YES;NO;NO;no refund, hard to reach customer service, useless virtual assistant (Amelia), changing flight schedule;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The costs are actualy not low-cost but the services are.

Flying hours are always obscure.

If you have any other option don't fly with wizzair. Take the buss.";;NO;YES;YES;obscure flying hours;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

No entertainment. And who gave the pilot the licence?! He prob. learned on Microsoft Flight Simulator to be honest. Worst experience so far in Europe. Ryanair could have done it better .????
The only reason I gave one star is because staff was nice and helpful (helped some disabled guy get on plane and troughout the whole flight they were able to manage each passenger, and made the babies stop crying).??????

2024-07-21T00:29:47.000Z;GB;;"Worst Imaginable ZZ-list Abusive Irresponsible Rated ever company. The WORST I ever used.
- without any warning postpones flight like for TWO hours - people miss theit next flights or trips and the company didnt even apologize as if its normal
- when you need urgent help, the staff (and I talk of the Chopin airport Wizzair staff members) acts like formal, not really going to help, probably have commission from increased prices of tickets and act correspondingly
- when you need to buy a ticket urgently and are in stranded situation, Wizzair on the site increases the cost of remaining tickets like THREE TIMES higher and capitalizes on somebody's problems, very inhuman and overall disgusting

- and yes - have you ever seen how before your own flight the plane is urgently aired after the passengers that have just left it, not all litter completely collected and the mechanics urgently visually inspect the plane's turbines?

2024-07-21T05:23:06.000Z;GB;;"WizzAir kept the charge for luggage I didn't actually pack, payment for a specifically selected seat but then changed aircraft and after three days of my relentlessly trying to check-in both online and on the WizzAir app unsuccessfully due to them having tech issues, I arrive in good time at Gatwick Airport South at 01:00am for a 05:35am flight to check-in in person to no staff, and no self check-in kiost option and consequently had to wait there until just before 4am for one WizzAir staff to eventual arrive and then charge me a further ?44.50 as a check-in charge even after explaining my issues and then sending WizzAir all screenshot evidence attachments and also the receipt just for Wizz Air STILL unlawfully charged me and refused my refund claim request also, even due to THEM having system errors, website issues and WizzAir app technical issues ...but today they have the audacity to send an email mailout update stating that their system is now fully functional NOW plus working again for people to freely use and book further flights...whilst knowingly dissmissing claims, keeping advance seat and luggage costs and changing aircraft so seat selected via visual seating plan and Loveholidays travel agent all no longer applicable.

I have never ever flown with WizzAir in the past and this was the only option via a package holiday I had taken as a wellness trip vacation prior to my having major surgery, so booked via travel agency Loveholidays to stay in a wellness hotel in Marrakech and have never been and felt more stressed or treated so unfairly and disrespectfully than I have with WizzAir, being told over the phone that they cannot help as I booked via travel agency and this has been my first and ONLY time ever flying with them. What a great first impression. I am truly disgusted disappointed and extremely let down....so to now receive today's celebratory email update stating Wizz Air system is now up and running plus working is ignorant distasteful and a sacrilege.

What a poor floored and negative business of thieves they are to run such a disorganised so called organisation. I personally would never recommend WizzAir to an enemy.";;YES;NO;NO;online check-in issues, no refund, extra fees, website issues;NO;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
